# httpkit
A requests + pydantic based fremawork to save you the trouble

## Installation

Add the **apikit** to the project dependencies using the **poetry add** command, or installing it with **pip install**. Specify the tag version if necessary.

```shell
poetry add poetry add git+https://github.com/Arbeit-Studio/apikit.git@v0.1.2
```
To install using **pip**, just change the poetry command to the pip one.

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/Arbeit-Studio/apikit.git@v0.1.2"
```

## Specifying the Gateway

O Componente base para declarar um gateway Ã© o `DefaultHTTPRequestGateway`.

The component is called **Gateway** to denote a passthought gate where we'll have a optional check-in for concistency on both ends, when making a request and when receiving the response.

In other words, it's a declarative way to define a request, specifying its HTTP verb, url, adapters, and expected data models.

### Example

On this example we declare a **POST** request to the [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org). 

The data expected to be sent as the request body are declared on the `RequestBody` class. You can call it anything RequestBody is just the name I choose for the example.

The data expected to be presente in the response body are declared on the `ResponseBody` class (Again, you may call it anything). 

The **httpbin.org** tool returns the same payload we send to it on the **json** atribute from the response body. That's why our `ResponseBody` defines the json attribute. You'll see in a moment. For more details on how to use httpbin.org for your tests check out it's documentation.

```python
from apikit.protocols import HTTPMethod
from apikit.session import DefaultHttpSession
from apikit.default import (DefaultHTTPRequestAdapter, DefaultHTTPRequestGateway, DefaultHTTPResponseAdapter)
from pydantic import BaseModel


class RequestBody(BaseModel):
    foo: str
    bar: str


class ResponseBody(BaseModel):
    json: dict


gateway = DefaultHTTPRequestGateway(
    http_session=DefaultHttpSession(),
    url="https://httpbin.org/post",
    method=HTTPMethod.POST,
    request_adapter=DefaultHTTPRequestAdapter(model=RequestBody),
    response_adapter=DefaultHTTPResponseAdapter(model=ResponseBody)

)
```

### Making the Request
To execute the request, you just need to call the gateway passing the request params if there is any.

```python
gateway(RequestBody(foo="foo", bar="bar"))
```

If you define the response model, the return will be validated and the response model will be instantiated with the data.

```python
ResponseBody(json={'bar': 'bar', 'foo': 'foo'})
```

## Easier Declaration with HTTPGatewaySpec

The easyest whay to define a Gateway is using **HTTPGatewaySpec** [descriptor](https://docs.python.org/3.10/howto/descriptor.html). Under the hood the Spec will create a Gateway based on the details you declared and bind it to your class attribute.

Modeling the same example from above using the **HTTPGatewaySpec** is simpler because it already use the default adapters, if you do not override them, so you just need to specify the *url*, *method*, *request_model* and *response_model*.

Under the hood the Spec will create a Gateway based on the details you declared and bind it to your class attribute.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from apikit.specs import HTTPGatewaySpec
from apikit.protocols import HTTPMethod

class RequestBody(BaseModel):
    foo: str
    bar: str


class ResponseBody(BaseModel):
    json: dict


class HttpBinOrgClient:

    post_foo_bar = HTTPGatewaySpec(
        url="https://httpbin.org/post",
        method=HTTPMethod.POST,
        request_model=RequestBody,
        response_model=ResponseBody,
    )
```

So, them you can make the request by calling the client object attribute.

```python
client = HttpBinOrgClient()

client.post_foo_bar(RequestBody(foo="foo", bar="bar"))
```

And get the same response as before.

```python
ResponseBody(json={'bar': 'bar', 'foo': 'foo'})
```

You can also customize and reuse the Spec by overriding it's class atributes. Then, every gateway created by that same Spec will have the same attributes, and you won't need to previde them every time.

```python
from apikit.specs import HTTPGatewaySpec
from apikit.protocols import HTTPMethod

class MyCustomResponseAdapter(DefaultHTTPResponseAdapter):

    def adapt(self, response):
        return response.json()


class MyAPIGatewayGETSpec(HTTPGatewaySpec, base_url="https://httpbin.org"):
    method = HTTPMethod.POST
    response_adapter = MyCustomResponseAdapter



class HttpBinOrgClient:

    post_foo_bar = MyAPIGatewayGETSpec(
        url="/post",
        request_model=RequestBody,
        response_model=ResponseBody,
    )
```

## Data Validation Parsing and Serialization

The hard lifting of validation, parsing and serialization is done by the Pydantic models you define as *request_model* and *response_model*.

Internally the default adapters creates a [TypeAdapter](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/type_adapter/) based on the provided models. Then uses it to validate the request data and serialize it, and also validate the response data and parse it.


## Simpler Models

If, for some reason, you don't whant to implement Pydantic's BaseModels. You can also use regular dataclasses and TypedDict as models for you data, if it's simple enough to be described that way.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from apikit.specs import HTTPGatewaySpec
from apikit.protocols import HTTPMethod

@dataclass
class RequestBody:
    foo: str
    bar: str


@dataclass
class ResponseBody:
    json: dict


class HttpBinOrgClient:

    post_foo_bar = HTTPGatewaySpec(
        url="https://httpbin.org/post",
        method=HTTPMethod.POST,
        request_model=RequestBody,
        response_model=ResponseBody,
    )
```
